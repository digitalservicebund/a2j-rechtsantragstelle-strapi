# ðŸš€ Getting started with Strapi

## Requirement
- Node 20 (There is an issue with Node 22)

## Quickstart

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Build and start the application's containers

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
```

1. Visit http://localhost:1337/admin/
2. Under Settings > Internationalization: Add `German (de)` & set it as default
3. Under Settings > API Tokens: Add new token and copy it to the `.env` of the A2J webapp

### Troubleshooting

If you get an error like `ECONNREFUSED 172.**.*.*:5431` on Mac, this is a [known issue](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/4783#issuecomment-301778969). Just remove the port binding to 5431 for it to work.

## Strapi CLI

Strapi comes with a fully featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI)

```bash
# Start strapi instance
npm run start

# Build admin panel
npm run build

# Start strapi instance with autoreload & content builder enabled
npm run develop
```

## Sync with remote instance

Replaces all local data with a copy of remote instance

### Note

- Requires both strapi instances to be of the same version
- **Deletes all local data!**

### Steps

1. Create a `Push` transfer token in your local instance ([Settings / Transfer Tokens](http://localhost:1337/admin/settings/transfer-tokens)) & save as `TRANSFER_TOKEN_LOCAL` into your local `.env` file
2. Create a `Pull` transfer token on the remote instance and save as `TRANSFER_TOKEN_REMOTE` into your `.env` file
3. Update the `TRANSFER_URL_REMOTE` (Note: this should point to the `/admin` endpoint)
4. Run `npm run transfer`

## Data migrations

**Be careful. Test with local dump first before committing.**

[docs](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/database-migrations)

- read the (short) docs!
- run **once** on Strapi server start-up (or reload when using `npm run develop`)
- migration files are run in alphabetical order (use time stamps in front)
- **no revert** possible
- only(?) use for data migration, not for changing database structure (do this in the schemas instead)
- you might not want to run a migration in unit tests -> check for `process.env.NODE_ENV === "test"` and return early
